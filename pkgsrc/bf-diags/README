Barefoot Diagnostics Package
============================
The <diag> package contains diag.p4, a P4 program that implements the pipeline
for standard forwarding, learning, and multicast. The package contains sources
for building libraries that provide APIs to manipulate the pipeline processing.

The <diag> package is organized as follows
    p4_16src: P4 sources
    api: Source code for the APIs
    ptf-tests: API tests
    thrift: Thrift API support

The package may be built in one of two modes:
    1) Simple mode: Thrift API generation disabled
    2) Thrift mode: Thrift API generation enabled (default)

Diags supports the following CMake configuration options:
    1) -DBF-DIAGS=on: Build the <diag> package
    2) -DDIAG-PROFILE=<profile>: Build the specified profile
    3) -DTHRIFT-DIAGS=<on|off>: Generate Thrift API (on by default)

Valid diag profiles include:
    1) Basic Diags          (no profile specified)
    2) Diag Single Stage    DIAG_SINGLE_STAGE
    3) Diag Power           DIAG_POWER_ENABLE
    4) MAU Bus Stress       DIAG_MAU_BUS_STRESS_ENABLE
    5) PHV + PARDE Stress   DIAG_PHV_PARDE_STRESS_ENABLE

Use the DIAG-PROFILE CMake option to specify the profile. For example:
    -DDIAG-PROFILE=DIAG_POWER_ENABLE

Note that you may build for only one diag profile at a time.

The following CMake options may also be specified:
    1) -DTOFINO=on: Build for "Tofino" target (enabled by default)
    2) -DTOFINO2=on: Build for "Tofino2" target

Note that you may build diags for only one architecture at a time. Since
TOFINO is enabled by default, you must disable it when you build <diag>
for Tofino2:
    -DTOFINO2=on -DTOFINO=off

Thus, to build Basic Diags for the Tofino ASIC, you might specify:
    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ cmake .. -DBF-DIAGS=on -DASIC=on -DGRPC=off
    $ make -j4 && make install

# Install additional packages needed for diag
    $ ./install_diag_deps.sh

NOTE:
    1) In order to exercise PTF tests, thrift mode needs to be enabled.
    2) Building in thrift mode requires additional third-party pkgs to be
       installed. This is done by the 'p4studio dependencies install'
       command.

# Building and installing
Refer to P4 Studio installation guide


Artifacts Installed
===================
Here are the artifacts that get installed for <diag>

Simple mode build artifacts:

  o header files for diag related API to $SDE_INSTALL/include/diag/
        api/ : header files for APIs

  o P4 (diag.p4) dependent auto-generated artifacts
      * header files for auto-generated P4 dependent (PD) library
        to $SDE_INSTALL/include/diag/pd

      * libraries for auto-generated P4 dependent sources
        to $SDE_INSTALL/lib/diag
          - libpd.[a,so]
          - libpdthrift.[a,so]

      * data files generated for bf-drivers
        to $SDE_INSTALL/share/p4/diag
          - mau.context.json: pipeline resource context for the driver
          - p4_name_lookup.json: context for model logging
          - tofino.bin: configuration for Tofino device

      * conf files needed by switchd application for PTF tests
        to $SDE_INSTALL/share/p4/targets/diag.conf

  o libbfdiags.[a,so] to $SDE_INSTALL/lib/
        library with diag APIs

Thrift mode additional build artifacts:

    libbfdiags also includes thrift versions of the API
