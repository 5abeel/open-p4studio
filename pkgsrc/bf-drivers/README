Barefoot Networks Device Drivers
================================
The <bf-drivers> package contains sources for the device drivers
for Barefoot Networks devices. The drivers are P4 independent. At the time
of device initialization they take artifacts associated with P4 as inputs.

The <bf-drivers> package is organized as follows
    include/
        Header files associated with various driver modules

    src/
        Driver source files. Largely they are categorized into these submodules

        pipe_mgr:
            Pipeline Mgmt API (e.g. tables, actions, stats, meters)
        traffic_mgr:
            Traffic Mgmt API (e.g. buffering, queuing, shaping)
        mc_mgr:
            Multicast Mgmt API (e.g. MC replication tree mgmt)
        pkt_mgr:
            Packet RX/TX API over PCIe CPU port
        knet_mgr:
            KNET Mgmt API (e.g Rx/Tx filter, hostif)
        port_mgr:
            Port and Serdes Mgmt API
        bf-pm:
            Port management platform interfaces and state machines
        lld:
            Low Level Driver (e.g. register/DMA, interrupts, MAC/serdes)
        dvm:
            Device Mgmt (e.g. device/port instantiation, HA sequences)
        pdfixed:
            An abstraction layer for API that are exercised by
            P4 dependent (PD) library or over thrift
        bf_rt:
            BF Runtime API that is P4 program independent and object driven
            docs:
              BF-RT Doxygen builder
        dru_sim:
            DMA simulation library to interface with SW device model

    third-party/
        Files of open-source third-party libraries used by the drivers

    kdrv/
        Linux kernel component of the driver

    pdfixed_thrift/
        Thrift IDL and API to expose the pdfixed APIs over thrift

    pd_api_gen:
        Barefoot ASIC P4 PD API generation templates and scripts

    bf_switchd/
        Reference implementation of application to exercise the drivers
